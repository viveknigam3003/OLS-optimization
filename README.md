## Introduction
A Linear Regression model is used to predict a dependent value of `y` using a mathematical eqaution as a function of some variable say `x`. This can be useful when the dependent variable only depends upon one independent variable. While in real life scenarios, this is generally not the case. A variable depends upon many linearly independent factors. Thus the equation is of the form:
